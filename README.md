# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease based on patient data.

Extracted relevant features from biomedical data using signal processing techniques and feature selection methods.

Implemented classification algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machines), decision trees, or neural
networks to differentiate between Parkinson's patients and healthy individuals.

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve
analysis, ensuring its effectiveness in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring.
